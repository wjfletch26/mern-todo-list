# Small Good Decisions - A To-Do-List App (because we could all use more small good decisions)

This is a Full Stack React To-Do List App I built with the MERN Stack:
- Mongo DB ([MongoDB Atlas Cloud](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas))
- Express.js for the Rest API / middleware 
- React for the front-end
- Node for the engine/server side code

### Other tools utilized:
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing the API
- Local MongoDB prior to using MongoDB Atlas Cloud
